# Zen Pad
## Simple code editor Chrome app

## Your code is the goal
Zen Pad wants to help you to focus on the one thing that really matters: Your code.
That's it.

## State
I use this piece of software on my Chromebook. It is in active development but as I try to keep it as simple as possible, feel free to fork and extend this.

## Contribute
If you think there's a bug or a vital feature missing, you may open a Github issue and discuss this with me and others.
You can also just fork and implement whatever you like - I'd love to see your ideas!

If you create a pull request, that'd be great. Please commit as often as possible and don't change the version number yourself. I will keep track of that for you :)
Please also make sure to rebase your changes with the master, if you haven't done so before.

## Special thanks
Very special thanks to the super great folks at [VisualPharm](http://www.visualpharm.com/) / [Icons8](http://www.icons8.com) for the neat icon!
